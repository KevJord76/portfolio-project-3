  - Guess the Famous Person (Hangman Game) is based on the classic pen-and-paper hangman game. You can read more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game))

  - In this version the player has to guess a random famous person's name rather than a word 

  - There are 5 categories to choose from: Sport, Music, Movies, Authors and General Knowledge

  - Once a valid category is chosen the game begins

  - The player has six lifelines, i.e. they are allowed to make five wrong guesses, the game ends if the player makes a sixth wrong guess

  - If the player correctly guesses all of the characters in the famous person's name, they win the game
